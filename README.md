# data-512-homework_1

This repository contains the Homework 1 for DATA 512 Human Centered Data Science course at the University of Washington - Masters in Data Science program

# Professionalism & Reproducibility : Goal

data-512-homework_1 project is an analysis exercise with primary goal to learn and incorporate the best practices for project documentation, as outlined in "Assessing Reproducibility" and "The Basic Reproducible Workflow Template" from The Practice of Reproducible Research.

## Datasource Information

The data for this project is extracted from the Pageviews API. The datasource endpoint is licensed under the [CC-BY-SA 3.0]( CC-BY-SA 3.0 and GFDL licenses) and [GFDL licenses]( CC-BY-SA 3.0 and GFDL licenses). The Pageviews API (documentation, endpoint) provides access to desktop, mobile web, and mobile app traffic data from July 2015 through the previous complete month. Leveraging the API, I collected the pageviews information using a subset of Wikipedia article pages from July 2015 to September 2022. Please find below the subset of the English Wikipedia that represents a large number of dinosaur related articles.

## Dependencies

Install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file using

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

## Issues and Special Considerations

The code has embedded exception handling to cover and highlight the articles for which we are not able to pull the page views information. As of now we are able to pull the information for all the dinosaur articles. Check for the comments in the code to debug the exceptions.

## Input Data Files
dinosaur_genera.cleaned.SEPT.2022.xlsx - Input data file that contains the subset of article names of dinosaur wikipedia pages.


## Output Data Files

### JSON Files
dino_monthly_desktop_201507-202209.json - JSON file that contains all articles pages view data for desktop access type
dino_monthly_mobile_201507-202209.json - JSON file that contains all articles pages view data for mobile access type
dino_monthly_cumulative_201507-202209.json - JSON file that contains the cumulative page views of all articles for both desktop and mobile access type

### Screenshots

Examples of output plots generated by the functions

- **Screenshot of plot 1: ** Maximum Average and Minimum Average

The first graph contains time series for the articles that have the highest average page requests and the lowest average page requests for desktop access and mobile access. The graph has four lines (max desktop, min desktop, max mobile, min mobile).

- **Screenshot of plot 2: ** Top 10 Peak Page Views

The second graph contains time series for the top 10 article pages by largest (peak) page views over the entire time by access type. The graph has the top 10 for desktop and top 10 for mobile access (20 lines).

- **Screenshot of plot 3: ** Fewest Months of Data

The third graph contains pages that have the fewest months of available data. The plot will have relatively short time series, some may only have one month of data. The graph has the 10 articles with the fewest months of data for desktop access and the 10 articles with the fewest months of data for mobile access.
